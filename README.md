In Lab 3, Web Map Application, we use 2020 U.S. population data from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimate and the U.S. Census Bureau's U.S. county boundary shapefile to visualize two thematic maps. Using web maps from Mapbox, the created visualizations are a proportional symbols map of COVID-19 cases and a choropleth map that visualizes U.S. COVID-19 counts. Lab tools used besides Mapbox were Mapshaper (https://mapshaper.org/) to access geojson files for our maps and Visual Code Studio to manipulate our data. Mapbox GL JS v3.14.0, HTML, and JavaScript were libraries also used to assist Visual Code Studio to process our data.
